# RMR Testing

This repository contains a **comprehensive functional test plan**, **bug reports**, and **automated tests** for validating the behavior of the **Reduce Margin Ratio (RMR)** field in Injective's perpetual markets.

## Test Plan

The full test plan is available in [TestPlan.md](TestPlan.md).

## Bug Report

All discovered bugs during testing have been filed as GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/piotr-iohk/rmr/issues) in this repository, and are cross-referenced in `TestPlan.md`.

## Test Automation

This repository also includes automated tests using `pytest`. The test runner will:

- Start a local Injective chain using bundled scripts
- Launch a test perpetual market (`TST/USDT PERP`)
- Execute test scenarios that assert correct RMR behavior
